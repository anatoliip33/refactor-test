== Task description

Your main task is to refactor the code as much as you can.

Setup project:

- run bundle
- run rake db:create && rake db:migrate && rake db:seed
- see email/password in seeds.rb

Task:

1. Refactor the code as much as you can. If you're limited in time, just write comments about how you would refactor.
2. Add bootstrap styles for story creation form.
3. Add edit functionality for stories.
4. Bonus: Add rating functionality (javascript plugin already included and used). Implement back-end, so 1 user can leave only 1 rating for any story. Display average rating in story header. Update average after user leaves/changes his rating for story.

Please, do not fork this repo. Clone it, create your own repo, push your changes and give me a link to your repo.
